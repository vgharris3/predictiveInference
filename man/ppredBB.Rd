\title{The Beta-Binomial Predictive Distribution}
\usage{
ppredBB(tpred, N, t, M, alpha = 1, beta = 1, lower = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tpred}{vector of integers: number(s) of successes for which prediction is desired}

\item{N}{number of observed independent binary variables}

\item{t}{number of observed successes out of N}

\item{M}{number of future observations for which prediction is desired (note x <= M)}

\item{alpha}{shape factors for prior Beta distribution on theta}

\item{beta}{rate factor for prior Beta distribution on theta}

\item{lower}{logical; if TRUE (default), probabilities are P(R<=q) otherwise P(R>q)}
}

Beta-Binomial cumulative predictive probability
