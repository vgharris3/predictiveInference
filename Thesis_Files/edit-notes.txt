In addition to what is described in the notes, I think you need more of a justification/motivation for prediction (e.g., in section 2.1)  The current description of the advantages is pretty thin.   Similarly with the examples. Frequently it is unclear what you are predicting and why.

==============================

These notes start with page 16 of your thesis. The notes for earlier pages are
embedded in you Rnw file.

p. 15 - example 3.2.3 This needs updating.  Also, think about the number of new
observations to be predicted.  Why would we (you) choose M=1000?

p.17. Section 3.3 title -- why the ff after the page number?

Again - iid or conditionally independent. de Finetti uses the term exchangeable
Why not this?

p 18. - you dropped d\theta from the integral 2nd 3rd and 4th lines of equation

p22. again, why the ff?
p 22,  - mid page - what do you mean sample variance and sample size of the
prior observations?  these are parameters of the prior distribution.  If you are
using the idea of an "equivalent" prior sample, you need to describe this in
some detail.

p. 23. 3.4.1.2 - are you saying that the predictive density and cumulative
distribitions are approximated from a random sample generated from the sampler
function? Make this clearer.

p.28.  I'm confused. What are M and S?  I presume one of these must be the number
of MCMC realizations? Do you automatically generate for a single predicted
random variable?

p 29 Are there data for example 3.4.2.3? You haven't described any. Maybe a plot?
Also - what is being predicted here? Is it a future single student from each of
the selected schools?

p.30 - Define \bar{\theta}?
p.31 Again. S is the number of MCMC realizations. "random sample size" is too generic

p. 32. check the school number that you selected.  school 100 or school 92 [FIXED]

p.33. As before, what is being predicted?

p.35. Your example 4.1 is much better described than the other examples. You
should try to bring the others up to this standard.

p. 38. define SSR(beta)
I think you should write out the full conditional distributions for the
different parts of the updating scheme, or at least the expressions for V and m.  
Similar to what you did in Chapter 3.

p. 39. First three sentences of 4.2.1.2 need some editing.

You say "g is typically set to the number of prior observations". I don't konw
what you mean by "prior observations".

p. 40. Again S is the number of Monte Carlo realizations.
Fix your equation near bottom of the page.
